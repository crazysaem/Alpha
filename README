Tutorial for initial checkout:

(Note: LibGDX 1.4.1 was used)
Copy gdx-setup-1.4.1.jar to empty directory.
Generate a project with the following settings:

Name: 			  Alpha
Package: 		  com.crazysaem.alpha
Game class: 	  AlphaGame

(The ones below could be changed):
LibGDX Version:	Release 1.4.1
Sub Projects:	Desktop, Android, Html
Extensions:		Ai

PRESS Generate!

After the project was generated, copy all contents from the checkout over to the directory where
the project was generated.

A modified LibGDX version was used, which can be found here:
https://github.com/crazysaem/libgdx
Clone it, switch to branch 1.4.1_mods, build it with:
  ant -f fetch.xml
  ant
Copy gdx.jar and gdx-sources.jar (with the right version extensions) to the gradle cache.

Now import to IDEA, make sure that gradle is in offline mode to not override the custom gdx version, and GO!
