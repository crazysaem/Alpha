Technical details:

Blender was used to create 3D assets for the game: http://www.blender.org/
The character moves via the A* path finding algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
The graph points for A* to use, are generated dynamically, based on the 3D world given to it. This is done by placing points in a 2D grid slightly above the floor of the world. Between each point raytracing collision detection then determines whether these points are reachable or not.
Custom shaders are used to create the blinking effect for the characters eyes.
